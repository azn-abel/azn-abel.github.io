title: Stop Slacking and Build Your Personal Website
categories: [Web Development]
---
You’ve probably thought about building a personal website at least once. Maybe you've even started one, only to let it rot in a dusty GitHub repo.

It’s time to stop slacking.

If you're new to web development, this may seem like a daunting task. If you're a perfectionist, your decision paralysis can leave you procrastinating. But here's the thing: your website doesn’t need to win design awards. It just needs to show people you’re serious -- and honestly, getting started is way easier than you think.

If you're reading this, you've probably come with some questions. Lucky for you, I'm here to answer some of them.

## What if I don't know anything about web development?

If I could go back to when I knew nothing about web development, I would start with the three essentials: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — although a simple site might only require the first two.

[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-introduction-to-html-and-css) is a solid place to get started.

That said, tutorials will only take you so far. What's much more important is learning how to find answers on your own. If you don't know how to do something off the top of your head, Google it. Consulting LLMs is an option, but if you want to truly understand the code you're writing, do so with [caution](https://cameron.rs/blog/dont-outsource-your-soul/).

Anyway, that's the advice I'd give to someone new. As for what I actually did? I dove straight into [React](https://react.dev/).


## What should I use to build my personal website?

So you know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript well enough to get by. However, in your search for the right tool to build your website, you've likely come across [dozens](https://2024.stateofjs.com/en-US/libraries/front-end-frameworks/) of frontend frameworks you could use. To make matters worse, everyone online is telling you to use something different.

What you choose to use depends on your motivation.

- **Want to be employed?**
  - *Use [React](https://react.dev/)*. It's the [most widely used](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology#1-web-frameworks-and-technologies) web technology in the industry, as of 2024.
- **Want to focus on content, not design?**
  - *Use [Astro](https://astro.build/themes/1/?search=&price%5B%5D=free) or [Jekyll](https://jekyllthemes.io/free)*. They have many free themes and templates so you can focus purely on your content.
- **Want to be hip and cool?**
  - *Use [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) or [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/introduction)*
 
The list could go on forever. However, your commitment to whatever you pick matters way more than the framework itself. Choose something that feels right, stick with it, and build your website. If you ever want to rebuild with different tools later, they will still be there.
